Evaluation of Coupling and Cohesion in the User Authentication Module of EduLearn Pro

1. Current State:

The user authentication module in EduLearn Pro exhibits moderate cohesion but high coupling. Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a module belong together, while coupling measures the interdependence between modules.

2. Coupling Analysis:

3. High Coupling: The authentication module tightly interacts with other modules, such as user profile management, course enrollment, and session management. This tight coupling can lead to difficulties in making changes to the authentication module without affecting other parts of the system.

4. Direct Dependency: The authentication module directly depends on external services or databases for user authentication, leading to high coupling between the module and these external dependencies.

5. Inflexible Interfaces: The authentication module may be coupled to specific authentication protocols or libraries, limiting flexibility and making it challenging to switch to alternative authentication methods.


Cohesion Analysis:

* Functional Cohesion: The authentication module primarily focuses on authentication-related tasks, such as verifying user credentials and managing sessions. This indicates a moderate level of functional cohesion.
* Low Informational Cohesion: Informational cohesion, which involves grouping similar data items together, may be lacking in the authentication module. For example, user profile data may be spread across multiple modules, reducing cohesion.
* Sequential Cohesion: If the authentication module performs sequential tasks in a logical order, it exhibits sequential cohesion. However, if authentication tasks are mixed with unrelated tasks, cohesion may be lower.

Proposed Modifications to Improve Cohesion and Reduce Coupling:

* Encapsulation: Encapsulate authentication-related functionalities into a standalone module with well-defined interfaces. This encapsulation will reduce direct dependencies and promote loose coupling.
* Dependency Injection: Implement dependency injection to decouple the authentication module from specific external services or databases. By injecting dependencies at runtime, the module becomes more flexible and easier to maintain.
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Ensure that the authentication module adheres to the SRP by focusing on a single responsibilityâ€”user authentication. This will improve cohesion and make the module easier to understand and maintain.
* Event-Driven Architecture: Implement an event-driven architecture where authentication events trigger actions in other modules. This promotes loose coupling and allows for asynchronous processing of authentication-related tasks.
* Standardized Interfaces: Standardize interfaces for authentication methods to abstract away implementation details. This allows for easier integration of new authentication methods without affecting the overall system.
